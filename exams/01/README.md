# Exam 1

> Weight: 10%\
> Due: February 2

Bob is a _lackadaisical_ teenager. He likes to think that he's very
cool. And he definitely doesn't get excited about things. That wouldn't
be cool. When people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- "Sure." This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How
  are you?" The convention used for questions is that it ends with a
  question mark.
- "Whoa, chill out!" This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM. The
  convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!" This is what he says if you yell a
  question at him.
- "Fine. Be that way!" This is how he responds to silence. The
  convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of
  whitespace characters.
- "Whatever." This is what he answers to anything else.

Your repository includes an `index.ts` file with tests for a function
named `bob`. Your task for this assignment is to implement this function
so that it returns how Bob would respond when someone speaks to him or
asks a question.

## Starter files and submission

To access the starter files, first [accept the assignment][Classroom],
then download the repository (Code → Download ZIP). To submit your
assignment, upload only the `index.ts` on GitHub. Do not rename it, zip
it, or place it inside a folder.
